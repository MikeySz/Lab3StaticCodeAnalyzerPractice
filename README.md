#Brief Description
In my Software Assurance Course, we were assigned to conduct a lab in which we conduct a manual code review of a few files. 
The goal is to find potential security vulnerabilities and quality defects.
After which we use (Synk)[https://snyk.io/about/] to conduct an automate test of the repo and find potential vulnerabilties via Synk's static code analysis tool.
